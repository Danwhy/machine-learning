## Linear Regression

Linear regression measures the relationship between one or more variables _X_, and the result variable _y_.

In machine learning, we can use the Gradient Descent algorithm to find the best relationship between the variables.
#### Cost function:  

The cost function establishes the cost of our current model. That is, how far from the actual result is our hypothesis.
